This project is a brief quiz on Javascript built using JavaScript. The quiz prompts the user with a begin button that will start the timer for the quiz. The user then has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. Every time the user clicks on an incorrect answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the time remaining. There are 4 multiple choice questions built into the quiz. When time is out and no questions are remaining, the user is presented with their final score.
